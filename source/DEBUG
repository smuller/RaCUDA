                      Debugging
                      ---------

First, you can build a bytecode executable of the
analysis with debugging symbols embedded using the
command "make Driver.d.byte".

Then, if you have a problem with an exception, you
should use

    export OCAMLRUNPARM=b

inside the terminal you're using.  This will display
the backtrace when an exception is raised.

----------

During my debugging adventures I sometimes write
code useful to see what is going on.

Analysis.Potential.solve

      let f s sol =
        Format.eprintf "@.--- %s@." s;
        Format.eprintf "VMAX = %g@." sol.(vmax);
        List.iter2 (fun pol k ->
          let k = sol.(k) in
          if abs_float k >= fsmall then Format.eprintf "%g %a@." k Poly.print pol)
          (List.rev pl) kpl
      in
