CONFIGURATION and COMPILATION
-----------------------------

1. Copy Makefile.config.model into Makefile.config and edit the
   _PREFIX paths to suit your installation (you might want to set
   APRON_PREFIX, CAMLIDL_PREFIX and CAML_PREFIX to /usr/local
   instead of the default /usr).

2. If you download via subversion repository, and you want the
   OCaml API: 'make rebuild'

3. 'make'
   'make install'

4. Other targets:

   make doc (not useful for a normal user)
   make clean (clean things, with the exception of generated files)
   make mostlyclean (clean all it can clean, implies clean)
   make rebuild (rebuild generated files, mainly for OCaml interface)
   make distclean (clean the distribution directories)
   make install (installs in directories specified in Makefile.config)
